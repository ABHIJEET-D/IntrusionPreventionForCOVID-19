# IntrusionPreventionForCOVID-19
ABSTRACT
Face Mask Detection Platform uses Artificial intelligence to recognize if a user is not wearing a mask. Users can also add faces and phone numbers in case they are not wearing a mask. If the camera captures an unrecognized face, a notification can be sent out to the administrator.

PROBLEM DEFINATION
The mask can help preventing or reduce the risk of spreading respiratory diseases from person to person. Common symptoms of coronavirus disease include fever, tiredness, sore throat, nasal congestion , loss of taste and smell . In most cases, it is transmitted directly (person to person) through respiratory droplets. Our project checks whether person is wearing mask or not and accordingly it allows a person to enter into the office or room.![Picture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57065159/117442235-1cc94c00-af54-11eb-9fcd-1da928684db7.png)


SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The current system is evaluated with different classifiers. The best system because, We're headed for a faceless future as masks become the new normal. That can be a big security concern. Experts say mass mask-wearing could complicate crime investigations in the coming days, as facial recognition becomes an important part in tracking criminals. This challenge may create a scope to new face detection algorithms which can identify faces which are covered with greater accuracies.

EXPECTED OUTCOME
It is suggested to wear a face mask and maintain social distancing to avoid coming in contact with novel corona virus. Therefore, we are going to build a Raspberry Pi-based face
mask detector which detects whether the person is wearing mask or not. Also it will check body temperature of the person and whether the person is following proper social distancing or not. Accordingly It open's the door if all the conditions are satisfied by the person.
